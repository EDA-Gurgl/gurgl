Hello friends (-:

# ESLint Standard

Link to rules: <https://standardjs.com/rules.html>

Commands:

- 'npm run lint' to get errors for all files
 ( you'll get a lot of npm ERR! messages don't worry they're expected)
- 'npm run fix' to fix all fixable errors

Run eslint_all and fix errors before you push!
