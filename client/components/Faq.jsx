      <h3> Why does Gurgle exist? </h3>
      <p>
      Inspired to reduce the impact on our plant, to lessen our footprint and to support local communities, Gurgl is the brainchild of a newly qualified web-developer who wanted an excuse to practise her skills. The idea was solidified during excitable conversations and dinners with friends and their new borns...
      </p>
      <p>
      With little encouragement the developer set about creating a business model, a network and a website. She now dreams of bringing Gurgl to every town, and anyone who can benefit from the borrow-a-bib service they provide. So please, spread the news, tell your fiends and feel free to oooh and ahhh over <em>her</em> new baby!
      </p>

      <h3> How does it work? </h3>
      <p>
      We take donations of preloved clothing from individuals and organisations with clothing to spare. Each item is checkoed over and cleaned. So that you can flick through our gallery and choose the gurgl-iscious items you would like to borrow. Select and add them to your basket, once you are done, you simply complete your details and we will send you your items. They are due back 2 months from the day you book them out - or when your little-ones grow out of them. Once you return the items you have borrowed, you can borrow more!
      </p>
      <p>
      Obviously the cleaning and the postage all cost money, which is why we ask for a membership fee, this payment is required at the point you place your first order and from that month onwards it goes directly to continuing all the services we provide. Gurgl is a not for profit organisation, so any excess funds will be donated to a local charitable cause.
      </p>

      <h3> What are the rankings? </h3>
      <p>
      When you place your first order with Gurgl you are allocated Bronze membership. Assuming you follow our T&C's and behaviour standards, your ranking organically increases every year that you continue to be a member. The other ranks to aspire to are, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Diamond ranking is reserved for people who have also been contributors.
      </p>

      <h3> How many items can I hire? </h3>
      <p>
