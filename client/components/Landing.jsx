      <h3> Our mission is to save resources, save our planet and save you money.</h3>
      <p>
      Through donations from individuals (like you), and organisations with clothing to spare. We plan on creating a circular-economy. Where we reduce the amount of newly purchased fast-fashion items in production. Replacing them with ecocycled rescued items with lots more love to give.
      </p>
      <p>
      We provide a fun, easy platform for you to recycle your childrens wardrobes, and borrow more! With your help we can redirect perfectly good clothing out of the landfill waste pile and onto the backs of children who need them.
      </p>
      <p>
      We can all play our part. We can have a positive impact on our planet and leave it in a better preloved condition for the next generations of Kiwis.
