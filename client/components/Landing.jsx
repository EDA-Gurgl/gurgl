      Gurgl's mission is to save you money. Save resources and hopefully save our plant!
      </p>
      <p>
      Through donations from individuals - like you, and organisations with clothing to spare. We plan on creating a circular-economy. Where we reduce the amount of newly purchased fast-fashion items in production. Replacing them with ecocycled rescued items with lots more love to give.
      </p>
      <p>
      We provide a fun, easy platform for you to recycle your childrens wardrobes, and borrow more! With your help we can redirect perfectly good clothing out of the landfill waste pile and onto the backs of children who need them
      </p>
      <p>
      We can play our part. Have a positive impact on our plant and leave it in a better pre-loved condition for the next generations of Kiwis.
