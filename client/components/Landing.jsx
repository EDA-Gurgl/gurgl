      <h3> Our mission is to save resources, save our planet and save you money.</h3>
      <p>
      Through donations from individuals (like you), and organisations with clothing to spare. We hope to create a circular-economy. <br /> Where we reduce the amount of newly purchased fast-fashion items in production. <br />
      Replacing them with rescued items, which have lots more love to give.
      </p>
      <p>
      We provide a fun, easy platform for you to recycle your childrens wardrobes, and borrow more! With your help, we <br />
      can redirect perfectly good clothing out of the landfill waste pile and onto the backs of children who need them.
      </p>
      <p>
      We can all play our part. We can have a positive impact on our planet and leave it in a better, preloved <br />
      condition for the next generations of Kiwis.
